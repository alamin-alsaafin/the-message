                                      Allah holds the Heavens and the Earth from
                                    falling apart. If they do fall apart, no one could
                                    hold them [in place] after Him.He is Ever Most
                                    Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.

                                     They swore by God their strongest oaths that
                                    if a warner came to them, they would be more
                                    guided than [any] one of the [previous] nations.
                                    But when a warner came to them, it did not
                                    increase them but aversion [from the truth].

                                     Then do they await God's decree of punishment
                                    that befell on the previous generations? You
                                    will never find any change in God's system or
                                    method, and you will never find in the manner
                                    of God any alteration.

                                     Have they not traveled through the land and
                                    observed how the end of those before them was?
                                    They were greater than them in power.

                                     But nothing is hard or difficult for God to do in
                                    Heavens or on the Earth. He is Ever Knowing
                                    and Competent.

                                        If God were to impose blame on the people for
                                    what they have earned, He would not leave a
                                    living creature on the surface of the Earth
                                    [He will end life on our plant];

                                      But He put them off for a specified term.
                                    When their time comes, then verily [they will
                                    know that] God is All-Seeing of the deeds of His
