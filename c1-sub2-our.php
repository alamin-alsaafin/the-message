                        <p data-aos="fade-left"  data-aos-duration="600">In Judaism, the name of God is a word of four letters,
                                YHVH, which is assumed to be pronounced "Yahweh".
                                In Judaism, pronouncing YHVH incorrectly is considered
                                sinful. Jews use the word "Adonai" instead in their prayers,
                                which means God. <br>
                                Many Jews also write "G-d" instead of "God". They do it to
                                remind themselves of the holiness attached to God's name.
                                English translations of the Bible generally render YHVH as
                                "Lord".

                In Christianity, the name of God is not
                human defined, but has divine origin and
                is based on divine revelation. Respect for
                the name of God is one of the Ten Commandments, which
                Christian teachings view not simply as an avoidance of the
                improper use of the name of God, but as a directive to exalt
                Him through both pious deeds and praise (... walk in the name
                of the our God, Micah 4:5).

                The simplest form by which God is referred to in the Old
                Testament is "El", likely derived from His being first and
                foremost. The word Elohim (singular Eloah) is likely derived
                from the same root and points to God as being strong and
                mighty.

        <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="300" class="aos-init  padding-y-0px">
                In Islam, the name of God is clearly
                defined and disclosed. His name is Allah,
                and it is pronounced with a long vowel
                “a”, Allaah.

               <p data-aos="fade-left"  data-aos-duration="300">
                 In Islam, there is a clear distinction between "Lordship" and
                "Godhead". The former is derived from the word "Lord",
                which means the master, ruler, owner and controller. The
                latter is derived from the word "God", which means the
                deity that is worshiped alone. Muslims believe that no one
                has divinity except Allah.</p>

                The old and new testaments

                <br>
                   He is El Shaddai (i.e. The Mighty), Adonai (i.e. the Lord and
                    Master), Qadosh (i.e. the Holy), Echad (i.e. the One). 
                <br>
                 Some of these names and attributes are very similar to the ones
                mentioned in the Quran, such as "As-Salam" which means the
                Peace, "Al-Ahad" which means the One and"Al-Quddouss"
