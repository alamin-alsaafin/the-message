                                So when We recite it [through Archangel Gabriel], then
                                follow its recitation. Then upon Us is to ease for you its
                                explanation.

                                No! But you [mankind]
                                love the worldly life and neglect the Hereafter.

                                  On the Day of Judgment,
                                some faces will be shining and radiant
                                looking towards their Lord.
                                And [some] faces, that Day, will be gloomy
                                [sad and miserable], expecting that something backbreaking
                                will be done to them.

                                pray to his Lord but rejected the truth and turned away.
                                Then he went to his folk in full pride.

                                 Alexis Fretz, a thirty-year old American women
                                from Pennsylvania, went into labor when she was
                                just 19 weeks pregnant with her third child. Her
                                son Walter was born and died in her arms. Alexis
                                wanted to share her story and pictures on social
                                media hoping that it will help open up more research
                                about pre-term labor and miscarriage, which affect
                                more than 1 million women in America each year.
