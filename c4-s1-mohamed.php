                        Prophet Muhammad conveyed the final Message of God.
                        He was the seal of prophets. <br>
                        History tells us that he was known for his fidelity, integrity
                        and trustworthiness. He never worshiped idols when idol
                        worship was rife in a polytheistic society.

                        He always believed that the whole universe must have been
                        created and controlled by one God. <br>
                        When Muhammad reached forty years old, he used to
                        meditate frequently in the Cave of Hira, which was on a
                        mountain 4 km east of Makkah.
                        <br>
                        In the month of Ramadan (the ninth month of the lunar year,
                        610 CE approx), Archangel Gabriel appeared to him for the
                        first time while he was in the cave and told him to “read”.
                        Muhammad was frightened. <br>
                        He could not read and did not know what to read. Archangel
                        Gabriel repeated his word “read” again and again, then he
                        recited the following verses from God.

                       Muhammad was afraid that he was possessed by evil.
                        He went with his wife Khadijah to tell the whole story to
                        Waraqa Bin Nawfal (a relative of Khadijah) who was a
                        religious Christian person and knowledgeable in the Bible.
                        Waraqa predicted that Muhammad would be a prophet. <br>
                        Gabriel continued to come to Muhammad over a period
                        of 23 years. During this period, God’s Message to
                        humankind (the Quran) was revealed.
