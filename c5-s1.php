                        Across the history, God revealed His divine Message to
                        His messengers from Adam to Prophet Muhammad. <br>
                        However, the scriptures of the earlier messengers, such as
                        Noah and Abraham, were completely lost. Currently, we have
                        three divine books: the Torah, the Bible and the Quran. <br>
                          If they were truly revealed by God, then it is reasonable to
                        believe there is a link between these three books because
                        they were sent by one God.

                        In addition, it is logical to ask: Why do we have three books?
                        Why are they not combined in one book that contains God's
                        Message to humanity?
                        <br>
                        Were any parts of these divine books partially or completely
                        lost over history?
                        <br>
                        What about alterations, additions or changes to the
                        pure Message of God?
                        <br>
                        Were any of these things possible to happen during
                        the last 3000 years?
                        <br>
                        The answer may surprise many readers when we look at the
                        history of writing and assembling the Torah, the Bible and
                        the Quran.

                        As Timothy 3:16 indicated, the Bible was “breathed out” by
                        God, "Scripture is given by inspiration of God". <br>
                        According to Christian sources, God inspired the human
                        authors of the Bible so that, while using their own writing styles
                        and personalities, they would record the commandments
                        and meanings intended by God.

                        The Old and New Testaments were written by approximately
                        40 men of diverse backgrounds over 1500 years, starting
                        from Moses and ending with John the disciple of Jesus. <br>
                        Solomon is credited with writing or inspiring much of Bible’s
                        wisdom literature (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, etc.).

                        was a prophet, Ezra was a priest, Matthew was a taxcollector,
                        John was a fisherman, Paul was a tentmaker and
                        Luke was a physician. <br>
                        Those who wrote the Bible lived at different times, some
                        separated by hundreds of years. In many <br>
                        They served under different governments, and lived within
                        diffrent cultures and systems of philosophy.

                        A few chapters in the prophecies of Ezra and Daniel were
                        written in Aramaic, which became the common language

                        the world and the Greek language was introduced to the
                        Hebrews.    <br>
                 The New Testament, however, was written in Greek, which
                        was the language of scholarship during the years of the

                        which was criticized by classical authors such as Plato and
                        Aristotle. <br> 
                        Two of the gospel biographies were written by the apostles

                        The current Jewish Bible, or "Tanakh," is composed of three
                        main groups of books: "Torah", "Prophets", and "Writings". <br>
                         The Torah contains the laws of God that were revealed to
                        Moses and recorded in the first five books of the Hebrew
                        scriptures (called the Pentateuch, literally meaning "five
                        scrolls"). <br>
                         It also includes the covenant that binds the Jewish people to
                        God. Although many scholars agree that the five scrolls were
                        initiated by Moses, they believe the Torah could not have
                        been written by a single person – because of differences in
                        style, language and some contradictions in the text.

                        The second part of the Jewish bible called "Prophets" includes
                        books from Joshua through Malachi. <br>
                         The third and last part "Writings" includes books from Psalms
                        through Chronicles. They are of later origin and are most
                        varied, containing works of poetry, "wisdom literature," as
                        well as some historical material. <br>
                          The order of the Christian "Old Testament" follows a different
                        logic. For example the book of Ruth, although written much
                        later, comes right after Judges, since the events it describes
                        take place during the same period. But the most significant
                        change is in how the books are ordered at the end.
