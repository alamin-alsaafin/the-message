                        It is important to realize the consequences of denying or
                        accepting such an important "divine message" because it
                        is related to your life, death and what would happen to you
                        after death. It is not like any other message.
                    <br>
                        It is a message from your Creator, the One who created the
                        universe and all beings. Think about it for a minute. 
                        <br>
                        Suppose you applied for a job in a big company and you
                        received a letter from a recruiting officer saying that you
                        <br>
                        have potentially been selected.
                        <br>
                        Of course, you will be happy, but your happiness will be
                        greater if you received another letter from the director of the
                        human resources department congratulating you for being
                        selected for a well paid job.
                        <br>
                         How about if you received a letter from the CEO of that
                    company welcoming you on board? Wow! That letter has a
                    lot of meaning.

                    Naturally, you prioritize your commitments in a way that
                    gives higher attention and quicker response to the letter of
                    the highest importance to you. 
                    <br>
                    Here is another example. Receiving a letter to pay a traffic
                    fine has a certain level of priority and importance to you.
                    But if you received a final notification to pay a fine within
                    48 hours otherwise tougher actions would be taken against
                    you, then this message obliges you to give it the highest
                    priority. 
                    <br>
                    Similarly, the final call to board a plane is simply "the final
                    call". If you miss it, you miss your flight and you may not get
                    your money back.

                        It is your duty to investigate the validity of any message you
                    receive and how genuine it is. 
                    <br>
                    The divine Message you read in this book is related to
                    your relationship with your Creator. It concerns your life. It
                    affects your well being and future.
                    <br>
                    If it is really from God, how awful the consequences will be
                    when you meet Him? Can you escape death? 
                    <br>
                    But, how can I know that the Message is truly from God?
                    What tools I have to investigate the "Divine Message"?
                    Well, nowadays we have more sophisticated tools than our
                    forefathers. In the past, life was very simple.
                    <br>
                    People used to use their logic for deduction and inference.
                    An Arabic anecdote attributed to a Bedouin shepherd says:
                    <br>
                    "if footprints on the ground indicate the one who walked on
                    it, and a dropping of a camel indicates that it came from
                    a camel, then a sky of constellated stars, an earth of vast
                    pathways and oceans of huge waves should indicate the
                    existence of God". 
                    <br>
                    Today, we live in a digital world of accelerated
                    technological advancements. We can fly anywhere
                    in the world. We can see what we could not see
                    in the past. We have sophisticated computers and
                    tools that can do what we could not do in old times.
                    Today, we have hi-tech tools to identify every person's
                    DNA and eye print.

                    We have tools that enable us to communicate with an
                    astronaut on the moon and spaceships going to other
                    planets. We instruments and machines that can tell us the
                    age of a mummy or a manuscript. So, Is it hard to investigate
                    whether a "Message" is true or not? Whether it came from a
                    reliable source or not?
                    <br>
                    God showed us signs that indicate His existence. For
                    example, the day and night are the most visible signs that
                    indicate the existance of a superpower that controls them. 
                    <br>
                The fact the sun rises and sets at specific times is a great
                    sign for us. Its disappearance and return at specific accurate
                    times without any delay is another sign.
                    <br>
                    And how many a Sign within the heavens and earth do they pass by and turn away from them?
                    <br> <span class="qura"> Quran, 12:105 </span>
                    <br>
                    I will turn away from My Signs those who are arrogant
                    in the earth without any right; If they see every Sign,
                    they will not believe in it. And if they see the way of
                    truth and guidance, they will not adopt it. But if they
                    see the way of error, they will take it on. That is because
                    they denied Our signs and they were heedless of them.
