                        Although the word "Quran" is derived from the Arabic verb
                        "qara’a," which means "read", it is only used to describe
                        the book revealed to Prophet Muhammad over a period
                        of 23 years in original Arabic through archangel Gabriel. <br>
                        It is considered by Muslims as the eternal Message of God
                            to all humanity. <br>
                              In other words, there was no human author of the Quran,
                            but there were writers for the verses that were memorized
                            in the hearts of many companions of Prophet Muhammad. <br>

                            collected in books that are called "hadith".  <br>
                               His teachings, way of life and explanation of the Quran are

                    Since the Quran is considered as God's Word, it
                    was written on parchment and memorized by most
                    pious Muslims (word by word and letter by letter).  <br>
                    Soon after Prophet Muhammad died, the complete Quran
                    was first compiled in one book when Abu Baker became
                    the first caliph in Islam. <br>
                     The situation remained the same when Omar became the
                    second caliph. However, by the time Othman became
                    the third caliph (only 13 years after Prophet Muhammad
                    died), Islam had spread over large geographical areas;
                    therefore, several copies of the Quran were generated
                    from the original and distributed to different regions.

                    The second part of the Jewish bible called "Prophets" includes
                    books from Joshua through Malachi. <br>
                     However, the concept of recurrence "tawaator" is enough
                    to confirm that the present Quran is identical to the one
                    revealed to Prophet Muhammad more than centuries ago. <br>
                     Tawaator indicates that the same Quranic text was
                    memorized, recited and narrated by different groups of people
                    and generations without contradictions, disagreements or
                    discrepancies. <br>
                      There were no disagreements or inconsistencies among
                    the people who memorized and conveyed the Quran from
                    one generation to another. Tawaator confirms the absolute
                    authenticity of Quran.

                    According to Islamic teachings, the Quran cannot be read
                    like a normal text; it must be "recited". The style of reciting
                    the Quran is unique and peculiar. Muhammad's teachings
                    in his own words cannot be recited in the same style as the
                    recitation of the Quran.

                    Quran, 73:4
                    So when the Quran is recited, then listen to it and
                    pay attention so you may receive (God's) mercy. <br>

                     The Quran recitation rules are commonly called "tajweed"
                    in Arabic. It is believed that tajweed is a unique science not
                    available in other religions. <br>
                     It reflects the highest level of attention given by the
                    companions of Muhammad to preserve the way he recited
                    the Qur’an (word by word). Muslims trust that it is not only
                    the text of the Quran that was uniquely preserved, but
                    also the styles in which Muhammad and his companions
                    recited it.

            <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="500" class="aos-init">
                    The styles of reciting the Quran are documented by the
                    names of the narrators and recitors starting from those
                    who heard it from Prophet Muhammad until now. This is
                    across the whole Islamic world and continued from one
                    generation to another. <br>
                      Finally, many verses in the Quran contain direct speech
                    from God (in the form of calls) to humankind and all
                    people, as you will see in the following chapters. It also has
                    calls from God to the people of the Book and the believers
                    in the final divine Message.

                <p data-aos="fade-left"  data-aos-duration="300">
                        Muslims believe the Quran is different to
                        the Bible or any other divine book, simply
                        because it is the only book that contains
                        the "Pure" Words of God without being
                        rephrased by His Messenger or anyone else. <br>
                        If the companions of Prophet Muhammad captured the
                        meanings of God's Message and phrased them with their
                        own language, then the Quran would have been similar to
                        the Bible. <br>
                         Also, unlike physical miracles that were brought by true
                        prophets and messengers, and seen only by the people who
                        lived at their times, the Quran is considered by Muslims
                        as an eternal miracle that can be touched, seen, read and
                        conveyed from one generation to another.

                        the first verse revealed in the Quran started with the word
                        "read". The Quran is often described as "Al Kitab" (the divine
