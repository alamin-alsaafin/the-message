                            Surely he is your open enemy.

                            This is the right and straight path.
                            <br>
                             The Satan had already led astray a great multitude of
                            you. So did you not use reason? This is the Hellfire
                            that you were promised.
                            <br>
                            Enter to burn therein today for what you used to deny
                            <br>
                              That Day, We will seal over their mouths, and their

                            to find the path, and how could they see?

                            <br>
                             And they used to say: “When we die and become dust

                            “Indeed, the former and the later peoples are to be
                            gathered together for the appointment of a known
                            day." Then you who had gone astray and rejected the
                            Truth will eat from bitter trees until you fill your
                            stomachs with it. Then you will drink on top of it

                                 But as for him who is given his book of deeds
                                behind his back, he will cry out for loss and
                                destruction. He will enter into burning fire to
                                roast at a blaze.

                                Pompeii was an ancient Roman town or city near modern Naples,
                                in southern Italy. In 79 CE, the nearby Mt. Vesuvius erupted,
                                burying it under tons of volcanic ash and pumice of more than four meters high
                                <br>
                                 The site was lost for about 1,500 years until its initial rediscovery
                                in 1599 and broader rediscovery almost 150 years later by Spanish
                                engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre in 1748.

                                 The objects that lay beneath the city had been preserved for
                                centuries because of the lack of air and moisture. These artifacts
                                provide an extraordinarily detailed insight into the life of a city
                                during the Roman era

                                 Pompeii has been one of the most popular tourist attractions in

                                  It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts 2.5 million visitors
                                every year. When you visit Pompeii, you will be astonished when
                                you see the people who died approximately two thousand years
                                ago in the same position as when they were covered by the

                            The other side of the story of Pompeii is really surprising. Digs and
                                excavations found that Pompeii is full of erotic images as carvings,
                                frescoes, symbols, and inscriptions. Even ordinary household
                                items had a sexual theme. The ubiquity of such imagery and items
                                in the whole city was amazing.

                                Lupanar is Latin for "brothel". It is estimated that Pompeii had more than 35
                                lupanares. Given a population of ten thousand in Pompeii during the first
                                century CE, this means one brothel per 286 people or 71 adult males
