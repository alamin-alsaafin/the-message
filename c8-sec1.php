                            Every day, new people are born and some people die.
                            The average lifespan of a human being varies from
                            one country to another and can reach up to 85 years in its
                            highest record. Every person has a date of birth and a date
                            of death.
                            <br>
                              This means that members of one generation will continue
                            to die until the whole generation is replaced by a new one.
                            This cycle will continue until life ends on earth.

                            No one has died and came back to life to tell us what
                            happened after they died. However, people have different
                            beliefs about life after death.
                            <br>
                             These beliefs are primarily driven by religious faiths. People
                            of the book (Jews, Christians and Muslims) believe that all
                            who have died will be resurrected to stand before God on
                            the Day of Judgment.

                            In the Bible, the day when people come out of their tombs
                            to stand before their Lord is called "Doomsday".

                             In the Quran, it is frequently called "The Day of Resurrection"
                            or "Day of Judgment". It is also called "Day of Decisiveness",
                            77:13 "Day of Recompense" 82:15, "Day of Account or Day
                            of Reckoning" 38:26 , "Day of Assembly or Gathering" 42:7
                            and "The Imminent or Approaching" 53:57.

                             Also, Quran describes the day when life ends on earth:
                            "The Final Day" 2:177. In addition, it is given other names,
                            such as "The Hour" 15:85, "The Striking Calamity" 101:1,
                            "Deafening Blast" 80:33, "The Greatest Catastrophe" 79:34,
                            "The Inevitable Event" 56:1, "The Inevitable Reality" 69:1.
                             <br>
                            They ask you, [O Muhammad], about the Hour: when
                           is its arrival? [i.e. when does life ends on earth?] Say,
                           “Its knowledge is only with my Lord. None will reveal
                           its time except Him. It lays heavily upon the heavens
                           and the earth. It will not come upon you except
                           unexpectedly..."
