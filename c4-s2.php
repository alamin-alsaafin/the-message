                         Although Khadijah was 15 years older than Muhammad,

                        died in 619 CE at the age of 65. <br>
                         Muhammad and Khadijah had four daughters (Zaynab,

                        Indeed I am the Messenger of God to you all. To
                        Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and

                        is the one Who gives life and causes death."
                        So believe in God and His Messenger, the
                        unlettered prophet, who truthfully believed in
                        God and His words. Follow him that you may

                        I am only a clear Warner to you."
                        So those who believed [in the Message of God]
                        and did righteous deeds, for them is forgiveness
                        and generous provision. But the ones who strove
