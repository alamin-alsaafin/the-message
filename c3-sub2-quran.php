                        The Quran mentions 25 prophets and messengers by name

                          When they threw their ropes and sticks, Moses said:
                        “What you have brought is only magic.
                        <br>
                        God will expose its worthlessness. God does not amend
                        the work of corrupters. God will establish the truth by
                        His words, even if the sinners dislike it." <br>
                    But no one believed in Moses, except some of the
                        children of Israel while being fearful that Pharaoh and
                        his establishment would persecute them. <br>
                        Indeed, Pharaoh was arrogant on the earth and he was
                        one of the tyrants who transgressed all bounds.
                        <br>
                         Moses said: “O my people, if you have believed in God
                        and submitted to Him, then rely upon Him.
                        So they said: Upon God we do rely. Our Lord, make us
                        not objects of trial for the wrongdoing people, and save
                        us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people." <br>
                        We inspired to Moses and his brother: “Provide
                        dwellings for your people in Egypt, make your dwellings
                        places of worship, establish regular prayers and give glad
                        tidings to the believers."
                        <br>
                          Moses called upon God: “Our Lord, You have given
                        Pharaoh and his establishment splendor and wealth
                        in the worldly life, our Lord, that they may lead people
                        astray and turn them from Your way.
                        Our Lord, destroy their wealth and harden their hearts
                        so that they will not believe until they see the painful
                        punishment."

                            God said: “Your supplication has been answered.
                            So keep to the straight path and do not follow the
                            way of those who do not know."

                            We took the Children of Israel across the sea,
                            and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them
                            in tyranny and enmity until, when drowning
                            overtook him in the sea,
                            <br>
                            he said: “I believe that there is no deity except
                            that in whom the Children of Israel believed, and
                            I am of the Muslims
                            (i.e. who submitted to Him)."
                            <br>
                            God said:" Is it now you declare belief in Me! But
                            before this you were of the corrupters! So today
                            We will save your body so you will be a Sign for
                            those who succeed you. Indeed, many people are

                        cFrench medical doctor and a member of
                        the French Society of Egyptology. <br>
                    In 1974, the mummy of Ramesses II was sent to Paris for examination
                        and study. Bucaille led a team of French scientists in examining the
                        mummy. <br>
                        According to Maurice Bucaille, he was more interested in finding
                        whether Ramesses II was pharaoh at the time of Moses and to find out
                        how Ramesses died.
                        <br>
                         Bucaille's findings surprisingly matched the <span class="qura">Quran, 10:92.</span>  The body of
                        Pharaoh was saved and mummified after he drowned in the sea. What
                        Bucaille found was a turning point that led him to become interested
                        in studying the Quran.
                        <br>
                           In 1976, Bucaille published his book, The Bible, The Qur'an and
                        Science, which highlighted the fact the Quran contains no statements
                        contradicting established scientific facts.
                        <br>
                         He states that in Islam, science and religion have always been "twin
                        sisters". To know more about this interesting discovery, watch the
                        documentary produced by Farouq Abdul Aziz "Moses and the Pharaoh".
