                                 People were created by one Creator. As discussed in
                                chapter one, He is the same Creator who created the
                                universe and all beings. Some of His creatures are visible
                                to us and some are not. Both the Bible and Quran confirm
                                this fact.   
                                <br>
                                "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that
                                are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
                                dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created
                                by him, and for him." <span class="small">Colossians 1:16</span>

                                        Angels are invisible creatures or celestial beings that do
                                        God's will and carry out God's tasks such as managing
                                        certain functions in the universe. <br>
                                        Angels are God's soldiers. They worship Him and they are
                                        dedicated for Him (see Psalm 103:20, Matthew 26:53). <br>
                                        Angels are mentioned in the Bible from the Book of Genesis
                                        to the Book of Revelation.

                                        Psalm 91:11, Matthew 18:10 and Acts 12:15 indicate
                                        humans have guardian angels. Matthew 13:49 indicates
                                        that angels will separate the wicked from the just on the
                                        Last Day. <br>
                                        In the Torah, the term "malak Elohim" refers to angels
                                        and supernatural messengers of God. It is interesting to
                                        know that the word "malak" in Arabic means "angel". The
                                        Archangel is called Gabriel or the Holy Spirit. He is in
                                        charge of conveying God's Message to His messengers. He
                                        also appeared to Mary for the Annunciation that she would
                                        be the Mother of Jesus.

                                    Muslims believe that Archangel Gabriel revealed the final
                                message of God (the Quran) to Muhammad over a period of
                                23 years. Gabriel appeared to him in his actual shape and
                                in the shape of a man. <br>
                                 Other angels recognized in Islam are Azrael, the angel of
                                death, Michael, the angel in charge of nature, and Israfel,
                                the angel who will blow the trumpet to announce the Day
                                of Resurrection.

                                Genies or Jinns are mentioned in the Quran. They are
                                invisible creatures of God. <br>However, they can make themselves visible to human
                                beings. Unlike angels, they can be good or bad, believers
                                or unbelievers in God. <br>Those who are evil are called devils. Satan is from the jinns
