                                There are more than 600 individual skeletal muscles and 206
                                bones in your body. However, at birth, an infant skeleton contains
                                approximately 237 bones.

                                 The average adult body contains between 5 and 5½ liters of
                                blood and approximately 10 liters of interstitial fluid. This forms
                                approximately 60% of the human body. This ratio varies from 75% in
                                a newborn infant to 45% in an obese person.

                                 With the 60,000 miles of blood vessels inside the average human
                                body, you could circumnavigate Earth two and a half times

                                For every pound of fat or muscle gained, your body creates seven
                                miles of new blood vessels.

                                 Your body produces 25 million new cells each second. Every 13
                                seconds, you produce more cells than there are people in the United
                                States.

                                   Your stomach manufactures a new lining every three days to avoid
                                digesting itself. As a part of the digestive process, your stomach
                                secretes hydrochloric acid, which is very corrosive.

                                Your brain uses 20% of the total oxygen and blood in your body.
                                In a lifetime, your brain's long-term memory can hold as many as
                                (1 million billion) bits of information.

                                 Nerve impulses travel to and from the brain at speeds of up to
                                250 miles per hour, faster than a Formula 1 race car.

                                  The human eye can distinguish 10 million different colors. The
                                focusing muscles in your eyes move around 100,000 times a
                                day. If the human eye was a digital camera, it would have 576

                                Then He made his posterity out of the extract of a liquid
