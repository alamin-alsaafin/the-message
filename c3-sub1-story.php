                    Therefore, God sent prophets and messengers to

                        people about their Lord who created them and to affirm His

                    Approximately 1300 BCE, God sent Moses to the
                        children
                        of Israel and revealed the Torah to him, a book of light and

                        Then, after many prophets, God sent Jesus to the
                        children of
                        Israel and He revealed the Bible to him, a book of light and

                        believed him became Christians.  <br>
                    But the creed of
                        monotheism was altered to trinity and the
                        divine books were not protected from alterations as they
                        were written a long time after the departure of Moses and
                        Jesus. (The history of writing the Bible is covered in more
                        detail in chapter 5).
