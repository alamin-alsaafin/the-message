                                    For you, He made the earth spread out and made
                                    the sky a structure from which He sent down water
                                    to bring forth fruits for your sustenance.
                                    So do not attribute to God equals while you know
                                    [that no one is equal to Him].

                                    upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a Surah
                                    [i.e. chapter] like the ones we revealed to him and call
                                    your witnesses if you were honest and true.

                                     But if you do not and you will never be able to, then fear
                                    the Fire, whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for
                                    the disbelievers. <br>

                                    infants, then (give you growth) that you attain
