                    guidance and instruction for
                    God-fearing people. <br>

                    have found therein much
                    incongruity (inconsistency). <br>

                    this Quran to be produced
                    by other than Allah, but it is a
                    confirmation of the revelation
                    made before it and a detailed
                    explanation of the Book (former

                Since Revelation and Until Now</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="300" class="aos-init  ">Ijaza is a uique certificate of authenticity that is granted by a
                certified scholar or committee to a person who has memorized
                the whole Quran by heart and perfected its recitation according
                to the unbroken chain of certified instructors going back to
                Prophet Muhammad. <br>
                It is only issued by scholars who have "ijaza," i.e. they were certified
                by others according to the same accredited styles of recitation.
                <br>
                Therefore, ijaza is the highest level of authenticity because it
                conditions or requires an actual meeting between the certifier
                and certified person, a tradition that has been maintained since
                Prophet Muhammad's time. <br>

                God, then archangel Gabriel who conveyed God's revelation to

                Muhammad who learned the Quran from him, then their

                It is like a family tree where each branch forms a chain of certified
                instructors. Incredibly, there is a 100% match among all branches.
                This is an incredible preservation of God's words to humanity
