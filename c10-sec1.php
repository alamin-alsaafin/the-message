                      <p data-aos="fade-left"  data-aos-duration="200">Have you ever talked to God? If God talked to us through
                      his messages in His own pure words, why do not we
                      talk to Him? Do we need a middle person or scholar to
                      connect us with God?
                    <br>
                    The answer is NO!
                    <br>
                    God is very close to us; we can talk to Him by praying
                      and supplicating to Him. We can talk to Him any time. He
                      listens to all of us and He has the power to accommodate
                      all of His creatures. 
                      <br>
                      Some people are atheists and some people believe in many
                      gods and superpowers that they worship, but this does not
                      change the fact that there is one and only one creator to all
                      beings. On the other hand, some people believe in God,
                      the one God who created us, but they have no relation or
                      connection with Him.
                      <br>
                      Is it not important to have a way of communicating with
                      the One who created us? How can this connection be
                      established? Well! It is easy. Have you tried reflection and
                      contemplation?

                    Reflect on the creatures of God, the creation of the human
                    being, the creation of the infinite universe that contains our
                    planet, and every thing in the nature. This will help you
                    appreciate the Power of the Creator and consequently you
                    will admire, revere and glorify Him. 
                    <br>
                    When you realize that you live in His kingdom, you will be
                    more careful not to cause any harm to anything in it.
                    <br>
                    Also, when you realize that God had subdued the sun, the
                    moon, the earth and the nature for the service of man, you
                    love Him. And when you establish this special feeling and
                    affinity with your Creator, you will frequently talk to Him to
                    seek His guidance and support.
                    <br>
                    Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and
                   the alternation of the night and the day are signs for
                   those of understanding

                    Those who remember God while standing, sitting and
                   lying on their sides and who reflect on the creation of
                   the heavens and the earth saying:
                   <br>
                   Our Lord! You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are
                   You, above such a thing. Protect us from the torment of
                   the Fire.
                   <br>
                   Our Lord! Indeed whoever You admit to the Fire, You
                   have disgraced him, and for the wrongdoers there are no
                   helpers.
                   <br>
                   Our Lord! Indeed we have heard a caller calling us to
                   faith, saying: ‘Believe in your Lord!' So we have believed.
                   <br>
                   Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and pardon our misdeeds
                and make us die with the righteous.
                <br>
                Our Lord! Grant us what You promised us through
                Your messengers and do not disgrace us on the Day of
                Resurrection. Indeed, You do not fail in Your promise.
                <br>
                Their Lord answered them: I do not neglect the deeds of
                anyone of you who works, whether male or female; you
                are alike of one another. 
                <br>
                So those who emigrated for the sake of God and those
                who have been expelled from their homes and those
                who have suffered harm in My path and fought against
                persecution and were killed,
                <br>
                 I will remove from them their misdeeds, and I will
                surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow
                <br>
                A reward from God, and with God is the
                most excellent reward.
