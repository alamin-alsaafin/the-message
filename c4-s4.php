                        pilgrimage to Makkah. It is one of the five pillars of Islam
                        that must be done once in a lifetime for those who have the
                        financial and health capabilities to perform it. It includes
                        performing religious rites in the Sacred Mosque and other
                        places in Makkah that have connections to the life of
                        Abraham, the father of prophets.</p>

                        By that time, most tribes in the Arabian peninsula
                        had
                        embraced Islam and reverted to monotheism. The Prophet’s
                        mission was accomplished in 23 years and his life was
                        nearing an end.
                        <Br>
                        On the ninth of Zul-Hijja (the last month of the
                        lunar year that
                        matches 632 CE), Prophet Muhammad gave his "Farewell
                        Sermon" to more than 100,000 people who gathered in an
                        area called Arafat.</p>

                        In his final sermon, Prophet Muhammad wanted all believers
                        to hold firmly to the Message God sent to humanity. His
                        Farewell Sermon was not a normal speech. <br>
                         It was a historical meeting between a nation and its leader
                        who conveyed a divine Message that brought light and
                        guidance to all humankind.

                        On that day, a great verse was revealed from God:

                        ...This day, I have perfected your religion and I have

                        2001, we have entered a new historical era that requires an
                        equally thorough re-evaluation. <br>
                         This notion was one of the reasons that Armstrong decided
                        to revisit a subject she had already covered in 1992 in her
                        book "Muhammad: A Biography of the Prophet." <br>
                        She depicts Muhammad as both a mystic and a wise political
                        and social reformer. He preached loyalty to God rather than
                        tribe; reconciliation rather than retaliation; care for orphans
                        and the poor; and in many ways, empowerment of women,
                        which was a surprise to some.

                        Armstrong indicated we must approach the life of Prophet
                        Muhammad in a balanced way to appreciate his considerable
                        achievements. He had important lessons, not only for
                        Muslims, but also for others. <br>
                          Muhammad literally sweated with the effort to bring peace
                        to war-torn Arabia. His life was a tireless campaign against
                        greed, injustice, and arrogance. <br>
                         She trusts that, if we are to avoid a catastrophe, the Muslim
                        and Western worlds must learn not merely to tolerate, but
                        to appreciate one another. A good point to start is with the
                        figure of Muhammad.

                        In every religion, there are followers who are extreme. Extremism
                        is a universal phenomenon that is influenced and caused by many
                        complex factors. It is not related to a particular faith or community. <br>
                         There are more than 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide. Muslim
                        extremists do not represent Islam. They are much less than 1% of
                        the total Muslim population. Many of these extremists join terrorist
                        organizations who react to political developments or acts that are
                        seen unfair or unjust to them or their people. They retaliate to these
                        acts in their violent way.

                        This is not a precise statement. The escalating terrorism in our present
                        time is initiated by identified organizations primarily for various
                        political reasons. Religion is not the cause of terrorist behavior, but it
                        is used by some extremists as a vehicle to justify their awful behavior.
                        Statisticians know very well the difference between cause and effect.

                        and way of life, then they are not among the Muslims. Further, he
                        condemned targeting civilians and instructed Muslim soldiers not to
                        harm any non-fighting person. He also stated clearly in his authentic
                        sayings that committing suicide is forbidden in Islam and
                        whoever commits suicide, he or she will be admitted in HellFire
                        (see Bukhari 5778 and Muslim 109).

                        (Spanish Inquisition), which was responsible for the torture and
                        killing of thousands of Spanish Muslims in 1478 following the fall

                             What justifies the mass killing of millions of native Indians by

                        the Holocaust (1933-1945)? And the genocide against Bosnian
                        Muslims between 1992 and 1995? Can we blame the Bosnian
                        people if they had Christophobia? Can we describe Christianity as
                        violent religion despite the fact the many violent acts, mass killing

                        This is the word Muhammad in Arabic

                        dome in the middle. The lower part of
                        the mosque is formed from the sentence
                        “rasoolu-Allah,” which means "the
                        Messenger of God”.
                        <br>
                        In Arabic, the word “Muhammad” means
                        a person who is highly, frequently and
                        repeatedly praised for his good deeds.
                        Therefore, he is a praiseworthy person.
